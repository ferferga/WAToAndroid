This python script is my own attempt to move my WhatsApp messages, as I needed a quick but custom way to move my messages and calls to a new phone.

There are methods explained all over the internet on how to get access to data in WP, check [this link](https://www.winwazzapmigrator.com/faq/windows-how-extract-messagesdb) for example.

This script lacks the ability to encrypt the database, as I was unable to get the way WhatsApp encrypts their databases using a Google's account. This means that this script
might be competely obsolete in the recent WhatsApp versions. Thus, this script is provided AS IS, there will be no further updates or support from my side, as it already served for my purposes
and WhatsApp is changing their databases very quickly.

You are free to use this script and modify it as you want, but please, give credits if a function or a piece of my code in this software is used in any of your projects.
