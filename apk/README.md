# WhatsApp APK

During all my research in ways in accessing crypted databases, I found
some websites claiming that the latest version that supports restoring local backups with and without encryption (like the ones generated by the main 'WPWhatsAppToAndroid' script)
is ``2.18.248``. 

Here you can find all the APK variants from that version, directly downloaded from APKMirror. They will be useful for you if you want to try to restore the
android database generated by my 'WPWhatsAppToAndroid' script (although I'm still unsure if it works). You shouldn't need them if you follow my new instructions, but here they are, just in case if useful for another backup or something else.

As always with software from unkown sources around the internet, use it at your own risk and take the proper saftey measures. 
I didn't checked, neither used them, so you've been warned.

## Troubleshooting

If you're from far away from the future, maybe, after installing it you will be welcomed with a message saying that the version you have installed is expired.
Change the date of your device to a date near August of 2018 (the date when this version was released). After doing this, you should be able to make a backup and go to a newer version
